    -   Save the script by clicking `File > Save As...`, and name it `practice_script.R`.
2.  **Write and run a simple calculation**
    -   In the script, write the following line of code:

        ``` r
        8 * 9
        ```

    -   To run this line, place your cursor on the line and press `Ctrl + Enter` (Windows) or `Cmd + Enter` (macOS).
3.  **Comment your code**
    -   Add a comment above the code explaining what it does:

        ``` r
        # This code calculates the product of 8 and 9
        8 * 9
        ```

### Exercise 2: Basic Data Entry and Operation

1.  **Create a vector of numbers**
    -   Write the following line in an R script to create the vector:

        ``` r
        numbers <- 1:10
        ```
2.  **Calculate the sum of the vector**
    -   To calculate and print the sum, add this line to your script:

        ``` r
        print(sum(numbers))
        ```
3.  **Save the script**
    -   Ensure your work is saved in the script `practice_script.R` or in a new script file if preferred.

### Exercise 3: Introduction to R Markdown

        ``` markdown
        # About Me
        This is a brief introduction about myself.
        - I am learning R and R Studio.
        - I enjoy data analysis.
        **Bold Fact**: I aim to be a data scientist.
        ```
3.  **Embed a chunk of R code**
    -   Include a code chunk that calculates the square of 12:

```{r}
12^2
```

4.  **Knit the document to HTML**
    -   Click the `Knit` button and select `Knit to HTML`. Save the output in your project directory.

## Instructions

This lab will focus on conducting multiple regression analyses and interpreting the coefficients (main effects) with a special emphasis on handling categorical variables using effect coding. You will work with various datasets to predict different outcomes, interpret the results, and understand how effect coding influences the interpretation of categorical variables.

### Exercise 1: Predicting Job Satisfaction

**Dataset**: You are given a dataset with variables `Work_Hours`, `Job_Complexity`, `Salary`, and `Job_Satisfaction`. Your task is to predict `Job_Satisfaction` based on the other three predictors.

**Dataset Creation**:

```{r}
# Create the dataset
set.seed(100)
data_ex1 <- data.frame(
  Work_Hours = c(40, 35, 45, 50, 38, 42, 48, 37, 44, 41, 40, 35, 45, 50, 38, 42, 48, 37, 44, 41, 40, 35, 45, 50, 38, 42, 48, 37, 44, 41, 40, 35, 45, 50, 38, 42, 48, 37, 44, 41, 40, 35, 45, 50, 38, 42, 48, 37, 44, 41, 40, 35, 45, 50, 38, 42, 48, 37, 44, 41, 40, 35, 45, 50, 38, 42, 48, 37, 44, 41, 40, 35, 45, 50, 38, 42, 48, 37, 44, 41, 40, 35, 45, 50, 38, 42, 48, 37, 44, 41, 40, 35, 45, 50, 38, 42, 48, 37, 44, 41),

)

# View the first few rows of the dataset
head(data_ex1)
```

**Task**:

1\. Conduct a multiple regression analysis to predict `Job_Satisfaction` using `Work_Hours`, `Job_Complexity`, and `Salary` as predictors. Be sure to use the `data` argument in the `lm()` function.

2\. Interpret the main effects of each predictor. What does each coefficient tell you about its relationship with `Job_Satisfaction`?

```{r}
# Multiple regression model

```

-   **Interpretation of Main Effects**:
    -   `Work_Hours`:
    -   `Job_Complexity`:
    -   `Salary`:

  Parent_Education_Level = factor(rep(c("High School", "College"), 15))
)

# Effect coding for Parent_Education_Level: -0.5 for High School, 0.5 for College
data_ex2$Parent_Education_Level <- ifelse(data_ex2$Parent_Education_Level == "High School", -0.5, 0.5)

# Create GPA with stronger relationships to predictors for significance
data_ex2$GPA <- 2.5 + 0.07 * data_ex2$Study_Hours + 0.03 * data_ex2$Attendance + 0.4 * data_ex2$Parent_Education_Level + rnorm(30, 0, 0.1)

# View the first few rows of the dataset
head(data_ex2)


```

**Task**:

1\. Conduct a multiple regression analysis to predict `GPA` using `Study_Hours`, `Attendance`, and `Parent_Education_Level` (coded as -0.5 for "High School" and 0.5 for "College") as predictors.

2\. Interpret the main effects. How does each predictor contribute to predicting GPA?

```{r}
# Multiple regression model

    -   `Study_Hours`:
    -   `Attendance`:
    -   `Parent_Education_Level`:

### Exercise 3: Predicting Health Outcomes

**Dataset**: You are provided with a dataset containing `Exercise_Frequency`, `Diet_Quality`, `Sleep_Duration`, and `Health_Index`. Your task is to predict `Health_Index` based on the other predictors.

**Dataset Creation**:

```{r}
# Create the dataset with a larger sample size
set.seed(300)
data_ex3 <- data.frame(
  Exercise_Frequency = c(4, 5, 3, 6, 2, 5, 4, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7, 3, 6, 2, 5, 7, 8, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7, 2, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 8),

)

# Create Health_Index with stronger relationships to predictors for significance
data_ex3$Health_Index <- 50 + 2 * data_ex3$Exercise_Frequency + 1.5 * data_ex3$Diet_Quality + 1 * data_ex3$Sleep_Duration + rnorm(30, 0, 2)

# View the first few rows of the dataset
head(data_ex3)

```

**Task**:

**Dataset**: You have a dataset with variables `Work_Experience`, `Education_Level`, `Gender`, and `Salary`. The `Gender` variable is categorical with levels "Male" and "Female".

**Dataset Creation**:

```{r}
# Create the dataset with a larger sample size
set.seed(400)
data_ex4 <- data.frame(
  Work_Experience = c(5, 7, 3, 6, 8, 4, 9, 6, 7, 5, 8, 9, 4, 6, 7, 5, 9, 10, 6, 7, 4, 5, 7, 6, 8, 9, 10, 5, 6, 8),

  Gender = factor(rep(c("Male", "Female"), 15))
)

# Effect coding for Gender: -0.5 for Male, 0.5 for Female
data_ex4$Gender_Effect <- ifelse(data_ex4$Gender == "Male", -0.5, 0.5)

# Create Salary with stronger relationships to predictors for significance
data_ex4$Salary <- 30000 + 3000 * data_ex4$Work_Experience + 1500 * data_ex4$Education_Level + 5000 * data_ex4$Gender_Effect + rnorm(30, 0, 2000)
